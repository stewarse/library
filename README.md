This is my library application that was developed as a part of The Odin Projects curriculum.
In this project I will work on the DOM manipulation techniques we've used previously as well
as how to associate those DOM elements with records in the JavaScript data sources. In addition 
to the DOM manipulation techniques this will be my first time using objects and the object
prototype in code. 

In order to add a book simply click the + in the bottom right of the screen and then complete 
the ensuing form. The book will be added to the library, where you can change it's status or 
remove it by clicking the "x" in the top right corner.
